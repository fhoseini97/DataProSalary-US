# DataProSalary-US
Data Salary Predictor
This project aims to predict the salary of data-related positions based on location, company review, and job title. The prediction model is built using linear regression and uses variables such as job title, location, and company rating to make predictions.

Steps taken in the project:
Imported dataset and performed initial data exploration.
Cleaned the data by creating new columns for salary estimates, extracting state information from the location, and categorizing job titles.
Prepared the data for modeling through exploratory data analysis and feature engineering.
Built a linear regression model to predict average salaries based on the provided features.
Saved the trained model as “Salary_Estimater.pkl” for future use.
